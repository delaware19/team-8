    <h2 class="hidden">Mission: To Help Everyday People Pass Their First Law </h2>
    <p class="text_column"> Rise is grounded in the belief that the voices of ordinary citizens matter, regardless of their background or age. This social movement blueprint revolutionizes how laws are created by organizing and empowering citizens to pen their own rights into existence. By identifying key battleground states, catalyst points for the movement, Rise creates a ripple of inspiration in other states across the nation demanding these rights are codified. The process—training organizers, telling compelling narratives in the media,creating visual cultural moments of protest, pushing legislators and building support between unexpected allies—has helped pass 21 bills to date. </p>

Until now. </p>
